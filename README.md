## Background & Objective
Globally, recycling garbage presents enormous challenges. This is due to the fact that waste is time-consuming, frequently toxic, and difficult to sort at the human level. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are two promising fields of study and invention that might be used to this issue. In order to sort vast amounts of waste quickly and safely, it may be more cost-effective, safe, and potentially even more accurate to use smart technology. This could increase the recycling rate. The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model that categorises photos of things and materials as recyclable or organic.
